LAB08 QUESTIONS:

1. Define an abstract class called Vehicle with data members: enginenumber(int), model(String), make(String), costofvehicle(double) and amount(double).

The member functions are:

i. constructor with arguments where the members are initialized and the tollamount is intialised to amount 0 

ii. set_tollamount(double)- that initializes the tollamount with value of the passed argument

iii. toString() – to display the members of the class Vehicle 

2. Derive a class called Truck that extends from Vehicle and implements interface TollBooth. Datamembers are: capacity (int), numwheels(int). The member functions are: 

i. Constructor with arguments 

ii. Override methods - toString() and deductAmount (double) 

iii. int getAxles() – that returns the number of wheels 

3. Derive a class called Car that extends from Vehicle and implements interface TollBooth. Datamembers are: noofseats (int) and mileage(float). The member functions are: 

iv. Constructor with arguments 

v. Override methods - toString() and deductAmount (double) 

vi. int getMileage() – that returns the mileage 

4. Define an interface called TollBooth with members: 

constant data members: carToll(double)intialised to 30,truckToll(double) initialized to 75

Static method – double deductAmount(Vehicle) that deducts from the amount based on the type of Vehicle

5. Define a test class and create objects of Car and Truck and test the functionalities.
