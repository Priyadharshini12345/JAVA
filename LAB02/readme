STRINGS, ARRAYS AND METHODS

LAB02 QUESTIONS:

1. In our University, student email addresses end with @student.annauniv.edu, while professor email addresses end with @prof.annauniv.edu. Write a program that first asks the user how many email addresses they will be entering, and enter those user given addresses in an array of String. The program should print out a message indicating the number of student addresses and professor addresses. 

2. Write a static method given as:

public static void palindromicPrime( int n)

The method has to print the palindromic prime within the range of integer specified by the user, n.

Example: 131, 313,757 are palindromic primes.

3. Write a method equalTo to check whether the given two double values are equal and returns Boolean value.

4. Overload the equalTo method to find whether the given two strings are anagrams.

Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters in any order. For example, silent and listen are anagrams 

5. Define a static final String array FLAVOURS that consists of Ice cream flavours.

static final String[] FLAVOURS = {â€˜"Chocolate", "Strawberry", "Vanilla Fudge Swirl", "Mint Chip", "Mocha Almond Fudge", "Mango", "Praline Cream", "Lichi"}

Define a method called flavourSet

public static String [] flavourSet (String flavor [])

that takes the array of flavours and returns the user preferred flavours as an array in the decreasing order of preference.
